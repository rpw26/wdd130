      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Ryan Wirth and I am currently studying cybersecurity.
        I enjoy learning how systems work and how they can be protected from
        different types of attacks.

      <h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
      <p>
        Cybersecurity interests me because it combines problem solving,
        technology, and critical thinking. Learning how websites and systems
        are built helps me better understand how to secure them.

      <h3>Basketball and Friends</h3>
      <p>
        Outside of school, I enjoy playing and watching basketball.
        It is one of my favorite ways to relax and stay active.
        I also like hanging out with friends and spending time doing
        things that help me unwind from school and work.

      <h3>Work Experience</h3>
      <p>
        I currently work at Five Guys. Working there has helped me develop
        strong teamwork, communication, and time management skills.
        Balancing work and school has taught me how to stay organized
        and responsible.
